                    <p>The team at Maya Music has made me feel so welcome throughout enquiring about lessons to taking my first one. I wanted to learn a new skill and was a bit unsure about learning an instrument as an adult, however the team at Maya Music have been supportive throughout my entire experience, offering classes outside of regular times to suit my work schedule and just generally being helpful and encouraging.
                        I'm just finishing up Term One and am excited to head back for another, my drum lessons are a highlight of my week and I feel like I'm covering not only the basics, but also the fun parts too!
                        I have and will continue to recommend the amazing staff at Maya Music - they're great!
